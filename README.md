Spontan Glossary
===================

Note on terms & definitions on specific categories of what I learned. One of the things that I need to answer first when learning new things is "what" questions. I have to make sure that I understand what I read, write, listen or talk about. It will help me imagine how "it"s behavior when that word or phrase appears.

The name `Spontan Glossary` is used because this repo of glossary is updated every time a new term need to be understood appears in a reading. I will never know when it will appear before me and challenge me before I get to understand the content of the reading. It appears *spontaneously*.

The glossary that is written in this repo may come directly from a source, I mean just copy & paste. In that case the link of the source of the terms & definitions (including images if available) will be included.
